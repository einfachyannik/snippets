To create a new config you first need a private variable ConfigBuilder with the name of the config, for example " locations ". You have to call this in the onEnable method and create a new config with " locations = new Config("locations.yml", getDataFolder ()); "
You also have to save the config with “ locations.save(); ”. Unfortunately, that's not enough. You also need to create an instance of your main class and a getter for the config, which you can make with " public Config getConfig(){return locations;} " to now write something in other classes you just need to do "Main.getInstance().getConfig().set("path", "value");" and then save it again with "Main.getInstance( ).getConfig().save();"
